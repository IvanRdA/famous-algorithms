# Famous Algorithms

## Overview:

This is not a project per se; it simply consists of files containing various famous algorithms that I have worked with or had to implement in some part of my code.

For now, the list includes:

- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Non-Maximum Suppression
- Quick Sort

## Installation and Configuration:

To test the algorithms, simply execute the command "node FILE_NAME.js" and you will see the result in the terminal console. Each file contains a method to create sample data.
